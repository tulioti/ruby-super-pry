# Ruby with Super-pry

Site: https://medium.com/@kevinyckim33/create-a-local-ruby-repl-it-with-pry-and-rspec-from-scratch-541eff11bbef

## Overview

This lightweight repo is the equivalent of [repl.it/ruby](https://repl.it/languages/ruby) but with pry and rspec installed.

I wrote an extensive blog post [here](https://medium.com/@kevinyckim33/create-a-local-ruby-repl-it-with-pry-and-rspec-from-scratch-541eff11bbef)

## Installation

Clone into local environment.

`bundle install` or `bundle update`.


## Usage

Play around at `sandbox.rb`.

Feel free to write tests at `spec/sandbox_spec`.

Run the sandbox by typing `ruby sandbox.rb` in the terminal.

Run the tests you wrote by typing `rspec` in the terminal.
